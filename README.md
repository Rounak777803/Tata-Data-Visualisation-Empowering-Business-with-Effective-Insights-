# Tata-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights
This repository showcases the work completed as part of the Tata Data Visualisation Virtual Internship Program on the Forage platform. This simulation provided hands-on experience in a real-world business intelligence scenario, focusing on data cleanup, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation to address key business questions from a mock online retail store.

#**üìä Project Overview:**#
The primary objective was to analyze an online retail sales dataset to provide actionable insights for the CEO and CMO, helping them understand revenue performance, customer behavior, and product demand for strategic decision-making and expansion opportunities.

#**‚ú® Key Tasks & Deliverables:**#
My responsibilities and achievements in this simulation included:

#**Data Preparation & Cleaning:**#
Executed robust data cleansing and transformation processes on the raw dataset. This involved identifying and rectifying 5+ distinct data quality issues, including filtering out negative Quantity values (returns), cleaning UnitPrice and UpdatedUnitPrice by removing currency symbols ($) and thousands separators (,), and correctly handling InvoiceDate and InvoiceTime formatting, as well as literal 'null' strings in numeric fields (UpdatedQuantity, UpdatedUnitPrice, CustomerID) for accurate analysis.
Ensured data integrity and readiness for subsequent analytical processes.

#**SQL-Based Data Analysis & Insight Generation:**#
Developed and optimized 8 complex SQL queries using MySQL to extract critical business insights.
Analyzed revenue performance by region, identifying top and bottom-performing countries.
Investigated monthly revenue trends and seasonality for forecasting, specifically for the year 2011.
Segmented customer behavior, determining the percentage of repeat customers, their reorder frequency, product purchasing patterns, and identifying top revenue-contributing customers.
Assessed product demand by country (excluding the UK) to highlight potential expansion opportunities.

#**Interactive Data Visualization (Power BI):**#
Designed and implemented 4 interactive Power BI dashboards based on the analytical findings.
Visualized complex data to highlight:
Time series analysis of 2011 monthly revenue for seasonal trends.
Top 10 revenue-generating countries (excluding the UK) and associated quantities sold.
Top 10 customers by revenue, ordered by contribution.
Countries with the greatest product demand (excluding the UK).
Ensured visuals were clear, intuitive, and actionable for senior leadership.

#**Presentation & Communication:**#
Developed a presentation script and recorded a video (as part of Task 3) to clearly articulate the data cleanup process, analytical methodology, and key business insights to a CEO and CMO audience, focusing on context and strategic implications.

#**üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used**#

**MySQL:**
For data storage, advanced querying, and data transformation using LOAD DATA INFILE, STR_TO_DATE, REPLACE, NULLIF, COALESCE, LAG window functions, and CTEs.

**Microsoft Excel:**
For initial data review and basic cleanup (as mentioned by user for initial cleanup).

**Power BI:**
For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

**SQL (DML/DDL):**
For database schema creation, data loading, and complex analytical queries.

**üìÇ Repository Contents**
SQL_Queries/: Contains all SQL scripts used for data loading, cleaning, and analytical queries (Q1-Q8).

**Power_BI_Dashboard/:**
Placeholder for Power BI .pbix file (if you choose to upload it).

**Data_Cleanup_Notes.md:**
(Optional) A file detailing the specific data cleaning steps and logic.
